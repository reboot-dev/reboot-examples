# Hello, Constructors!

This example builds on the basic [Reboot "Hello"
example](https://github.com/reboot-dev/reboot-hello) to demonstrate
constructors.

In "Hello, Constructors" a state machine can't deliver messages until
that state machine has been created by calling its constructor method, giving it
an initial message to display.

Read more about constructors in the [Reboot documentation](https://docs.reboot.dev/develop/servicers#constructors).
