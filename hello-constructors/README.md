# Hello, Constructors!

<!--
TODO: link to the more basic "Hello, World" example and mention that we're
building off it, once that example is published.
-->

This example builds on the basic Resemble "Hello, World" example to demonstrate
constructors.

In "Hello, Constructors" a state machine can't deliver messages until
that state machine has been created by calling its constructor method, giving it
an initial message to display.

<!--
TODO: link to the user guide once it explains constructors, with a mention like:
Read more about constructors [in the Resemble User Guide](
  link-to-constructors-entry-here).
