# Hello, Constructors!

This example builds on the basic [Resemble "Hello"
example](https://github.com/reboot-dev/resemble-hello) to demonstrate
constructors.

In "Hello, Constructors" a state machine can't deliver messages until
that state machine has been created by calling its constructor method, giving it
an initial message to display.

Read more about constructors in the [Resemble documentation](https://reboot-dev.github.io/respect/docs/concepts/methods/constructors).
