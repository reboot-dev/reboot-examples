# Hello, Tasks!

This example builds on the basic [Reboot "Hello"
example](https://github.com/reboot-dev/reboot-hello) to demonstrate async
tasks.

In "Hello, Tasks," all messages saved in a Hello state machine will disappear
after 10 seconds, with a warning displayed after 7 seconds.

Read more about async tasks in the [Reboot documentation](https://docs.reboot.dev/develop/call#scheduling).
